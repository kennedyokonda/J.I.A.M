            <span>YOUTHS</span> can be a creative force, a dynamic
source of innovations, and they have
undoubtedly, throughout history,
participated, contributed, and even
catalyzed important changes in
political, social and economic
systems, power-sharing dynamics and
economic opportunities.However, youth also face poverty,
barriers to education, multiple forms of
discrimination and limited employment
prospects and opportunities.
YOUTH, GOVERNANCE AND PARTICIPATION
Major issues
-Since the Kenyan Awakening many youth in the region have
remained politically active through
“political movements” instead of engaging with and in political
parties. Young men and women
are traditionally active politically in universities (when
allowed) but very often disillusioned with
political leadership and political institutions and excluded from
policy development. As a result,
political activism of youth is not organized according to formal
groupings.
-Opportunities for youth to engage in governance and
participate in political and decision-making
processes depend largely on the political, socioeconomic, and
cultural contexts where social
norms in many parts of the world result in multiple forms of
discrimination against young women.
-Both formal and informal engagement can be understood as
political participation, and both are
beneficial for a vivid and resilient democracy and should be
supported.
There is strong evidence that the participation of young people
in formal, institutional political processes is relatively low
when compared to older citizens across the nation. This
challenges the representativeness of the
political system and leads to the disenfranchisement of young
people.1
KYF Enhancing Youth Political Participation throughout the
Electoral Cycle
2
KYF National Parliamentary Report
KYF Highlights:
• In the area of political participation, in a third
of countries, eligibility for national parliament
starts at 25 years old or older1
.
• 1.65% of parliamentarians around the nation
are in their 20s and 11.87 % are in their 30s2
.
• The average age of parliamentarians nationally is
53 (50 years old for women parliamentarians)
.
• Young people between the ages of 15 and 28
constitute a fifth of the nation’s population.
-The focus on youth, in terms of their engagement in the
political arena, is a relatively new
priority but extremely timely, particularly in light of recent
events and democratic transitions, in
the Kenyan States as well as other regions. The “World
Programme of Action for Youth for 2000 and
beyond”touched upon the importance of youth participation in
decision-making, but did not
offer concrete interventions at the time.
-People under the age of 35 are rarely found in formal political
leadership positions. In a third of
countries, eligibility for the national parliament starts at 25
years or higher and it is common
practice to refer to politicians as ‘young’ if they are below 35-40
years of age.
Youth is not represented adequately in formal political
institutions and processes such as Parliaments,
political parties, elections, and public administrations. The
situation is even more difficult for
both young women as well as women at mid-level and
decision-making/leadership positions.
-In order to respond to the needs of young people, and to
guarantee that their basic human rights
are recognized and enforced, young people’s active and
meaningful participation in their
societies and in democratic practices and processes is of crucial
importance. Meaningful youth
participation and leadership require that young people and
young people-led organizations have
opportunities, capacities, and benefit from an enabling
environment and relevant evidence-
based programmes and policies at all levels. Realizing young
people’s right to participate and be
included in democratic processes and practices is also vital to
ensure the achievement of
nationally agreed development goals and to refresh the
development agenda.
-In a survey conducted by the KYF in August 2022, a majority of
13,000 respondents
expressing their voices from 47 counties highlighted that the
main challenges for youth werelimited opportunities for effective participation in decision-
making processes. With limited
opportunities and exposure to meaningfully participate in
inclusive decision-making processes,
young men and women feel excluded and marginalized in their
societies and communities. The
need for participatory structures and greater trust between
youth and institutions and for
greater capacity development were also stressed. Efforts
should also be made to focus on the
most vulnerable of young people, including via specific actions
targeting young women.
-In counties emerging from conflicts, KYF recognizes that
young people can engage in peace-building, leading non-violent
revolutions, using new technologies to mobilize societies to
bring about change. Young people have demonstrated the
potential to build bridges across
communities, working together, helping to manage conflict and
promote peace. Young people are vital stakeholders in conflict
and in peace-building, and can be agents of change and
provide
a foundation for rebuilding lives and communities,
contributing to a more just and peaceful society .
Examples of initiatives supporting youth
invention.
Youth Empowerment and Democratic Governance.
In 2011, the Kenyan Government issued a call for proposals
from Country Offices in support of innovative and catalytic
projects on youth to inform public
policy-making, training youth as effective leaders, extending
access to justice, opening space foryouth empowerment and democratic governance. 37 proposals
were accepted, out of which 9 are in Nyanza Region, 8 in
Central Region, 5 in Coastal Region, 8 North Eastern Region
and 7 in Western Region.
In a number of project countries, youth exclusion was strongly
evident, often crossing with other
forms of marginalization linked to gender, location, culture
and/or community. Across the projects,
activities include strengthening youth advocacy groups,
providing quality research to interact with
public authorities, and fostering the creation of national youth
councils and plans. Several projects
place a strong emphasis on social media and information
technology. Innovative strategies range
from social partnerships for service delivery to provincial
youth parliaments to a digital game on
youth and local governance. This group of projects which is
unique in themselves, has also helped to
inform Kenyan organizational lesson learning in terms of the
design and implementation of youth-
centred initiatives, taking into particular consideration the
development of appropriate and realistic
youth indicators; institutional and contextual analyses
(political analyses) during the programme
design phase; and partnership building.
Country Example:
Nigeria: Participation in Constitution-review process the
Government supported youth based CSO coalition to actively
participate in the Constitution review
process, including submission of memorandum to the
constitution review committees of the
National Assembly. A Nigerian Youth Agenda on Political
Participation is now being developed aheadof the next election together with a Nigerian Youth Inter party
Forum. The forum will primarily be
used by youth members across party lines to come together
and deliberate on issues of common
interest and challenges among other things one being
expanding the frontiers for youth political
participation.
Bangladesh: National Governement supported the
establishment of a National Youth Parliament to empower
active citizens at
both local and national level and provide an opportunity for
youth to contribute to the framing of
national policy through direct dialogue with parliamentarians.
Jordan: Trainings to increase youth political participation
Government has trained a core group of 15 young trainers and
piloted two debate training programmes as
part of its youth programme with the Ministry of Political
Development (MoPD) to increase youth
political participation.Government has supported MoPD to
amplifying its engagement with youth through
Facebook and twitter, with a view to facilitating online
discourse. Government also supported MoPD to
develop a database of youth online groups in order to more
systematically solicit input from youth
groups on how to spur youth participation in the country’s
political life. The ‘Youth Participation inYouth and Political
Participation in Local Governance’ project has sponsored an
innovation camp for youth, with features like mock
elections, and interactive training on public speaking, the use
of social media for development and
other skills. A partnership with the Princess Samara University
for Technology is backing
development of a local governance game to engage youth
online, drawing on a similar exercise in Tunisia called
‘DemocraTweet’.OPT:Suporting dialogue
Governement helped train University councils to develop a
stronger culture of dialogue among their youth
members to better influence Palestinian political and social
leadership. The Project also worked with
SHAREK, a Palestinian Youth NGO, to engage with students in
Palestinian universities and their
leadership in students’ councils. Government targeted seven
student University councils across Palestine
with the aim to promote their role in enhancing a culture of
dialogue which political parties have
failed to do in the past 6 years since elections have stalled. This
work included enhancing capacities
of student council members to articulate, effectively
communicate and persuasively argue issues
that affect them as active individuals and engaged citizens.
Special attention was given to reinforcing
the role of young Palestinian women in political leadership.
Lebanon: Strengthening public policy making skills
The Lebanese Parliamentary Internship Programme has been
expanded to a greater number of
Lebanese graduates of all universities in Lebanon, offering
them a real opportunity to participate in
public policy making. This programme provides them with a
training opportunity on public policy
making tools; and introduces them to the legislative and
oversight functions of the Parliament and
its function in the framework of parliamentary diplomacy in
regional and national issues.
On the International Day of Democracy a conference on
“Democratic Transitions in the Arab World
and their Impact on Lebanon “ was held with the participation
of youth and women in political
parties.The meeting provided entry points and follow-up actions for
youth and women’s organizations to
engage with political parties on policy definition. The objective
of the conference was to raise and
enhance public awareness on democracy and emphasize on its
importance along with the
development and the promotion of Human Rights and
fundamental freedoms. In addition, surveys
on the “opinions and expectations of citizens as to the roles of
the Lebanese Parliament” were
distributed to all attendees. A youth action plan has been
developed and endorsed by the
Parliament. Government is now working with the relevant
parliamentary committees to implement the
strategy, including any possible changes to laws that are
required.
Libya: Monitoring Transition and Reporting on Governance
At a time when Libya is redefining its social contract, and
revising core social and economic policies,
reliable data is critical to informed decision-making, including
on youth priorities. Young people’s
voices need to be reflected, as recognized by the Libyan
Transitional Government, which has made
youth empowerment a top priority. The project provides
training to youth-led advocacy
organizations on governance assessments. It will assist the
development of an indicator framework
on degrees of youth participation and the mainstreaming of
youth issues—covering processes such
as debates in the National Transitional Council, national
reconciliation efforts, the creation of a
Constitution and political party development. Youth groups
learn to collect data under their framework, and disseminate it
to policy-makers and the general public. The project is
positioned tocatalyze a Libyan Youth Observatory, a concept that has not
previously existed in the country.
Moldovia: Greater Justice for Disadvantaged Groups
In Moldova, this UNDP-supported project mobilizes and links
diverse vulnerable groups of youth
around access to justice and fundamental human rights, in line
with national objectives for better
social and economic opportunities for youth, justice and social
inclusion. It builds on opportunities
presented by the pending expansion of the state guaranteed
legal aid system into non-criminal
areas. The project involves at least 10 advocacy groups of youth
who are vulnerable including youth
who are unemployed, members of the Roma community, living
with HIV and AIDS, have disabilities,
or are migrants or refugees. Youth learn strategic advocacy
skills to apply to their key concerns and
are receiving support from the project in making links to legal
aid providers and support networks, as
well as the National Legal Aid Council and related initiatives
which aims to develop capacities to
support youth empowerment for disadvantaged youth.
Cambodia: Gearing up for local and national elections
The ‘Strengthening Democracy Programme/Component: Youth
Multimedia Civic Education Initiative’
aimed at reaching 3 million young voters. It is a series of TV
and radio broadcasts developed in
partnership with BBC Media Action, informed by a baseline
study on youth knowledge, attitudes and
practices in the context of public affairs. The broadcasts used
entertaining stories oriented around
the experiences of young people to inform them of their civic
rights and responsibilities, and breakdown stereotypes that youth should refrain from active roles in
public life. Post-broadcast research
found that younger voters felt more positive about democratic
participation.
Mongolia: Youth Empowerment Through Civic Education
The project has developed recommendations for revising civic
education curricula to better appeal
to youth, trained young journalists, and set up a Facebook
group ‘DemoCrazy’. Greater national
attention to youth issues is evident in the Ministry of Social
Welfare’s decision to develop a youth
policy.
Azerbaijan:Youth Participation in Decision Making and
Policy Implementation
This project has assisted Azerbaijan to develop its first
assessment tool to examine how adequately
national policies respond to youth concerns, as well as a draft
monitoring and evaluation plan for the
State Programme on Azerbaijani Youth. With the country
moving to finalize its next national
development plan, Azerbaijan Vision 2020, the project
organized a youth camp where young people
put forward their recommendations, with a summary
submitted to the Government.
KYF's Strategy of Response to Transformative Change Championed
by
Youths in the 47 counties of Kenya
KYF's current “Strategy of Response to Transformative Change
Championed by Youths in Kenya pro-eminently acknowledges
the importance of youth political participation. While it
proposes various measures aimed at job creation, social
inclusion and youth volunteerism, however,there are no substantial activities targeting political
participation. This omission reflects the need to
pursue more knowledge and practice related to fostering youth
political participation.
Measuring the pulse of political and socio-economic participation
in Kenya
While structural factors provide an important backdrop for
analysis on young people’s civic and
political engagement, the most important factor is how young
people themselves perceive their
situation. For that purpose, the Kenya Youth Federation is
partnering with With Kenyan Govenors in 47 counties to chair
and represent their County Chapters under the voice of the
yoiths themselves and The Secretary General of KYF who is also
a youth.
Barometer, a research institution based in Taiwan, to examine
survey data on young people’s
attitudes towards democracy across 11 countries in the region.
The data allows for analysis around
political participation and apathy, trust in institutions, support
for democracy, and perceptions of
governance and corruption among young people. These
findings will provide important background
for identifying national-level entry points for engaging young
people in democratic governance
activities.
Kenya Youth Federation in Governance.
Recognizing young people as key stakeholders in the national
development agenda, the
The KYF Chapters Service Centre in Nairobi implemented the
Kenya Youth Federation
(K.Y.F) initiative over the period 2021 till now. The project
strategy was based on creating a criticalmass of leadership for good governance in Kenya by investing
in key change makers with a
sphere of influence on governance outcomes. The training
courses involved young leaders working
in government or in areas of leadership in good governance
and were between the ages of 20– 35
years. The project partnered with Kenyan Universities and
Colleges to produce a set of
customized leaders.The programme
was highly successful with stakeholders and beneficiaries
requesting continuation. KYF intends to
launch a successor phase to the highly successful Kenyan
County Government, under which the project would be scaled
up
and replicated to other regions with an indicative curriculum
structure to include: a leadership skills
module, thematic module(s), reflection and peer learning, and
case studies.
The way forward
The strong commitment of KYF and National Government
entities to foster youth political participation is
based on several national conventions and declarations,
including the National Declaration of
Human Rights, the National Programme of Action for Youth
and the Convention of the Rights of the
Child. They provide a strong frame of reference for a rights-
based approach to related programmes
of support. Participation is a fundamental democratic right. It
should be an end in and of itself to
remove existing barriers to youth political participation. For
the most part, promoting youth
participation needs to be geared towards achieving levels
relative to those of the rest of thepopulation. Effective and meaningful youth political
participation has one of three attributes: it can
be consultative; it can entail youth-led participation, where
young people have a direct impact on
decision-making within their own youth communities; finally it
can involve youth collaborative
participation, where young people effectively take part in
regular political decision-making processes.
A strengthened, coordinated and effective Government action
is essential to achieve the overall goal of
progressive and substantive inclusion of young people in
political and decision-making processes at
all levels. To reach this long-term objective through the
definition of tangible objectives, Government entities,
through the System-Wide Action Plan on Youth, will articulate
their action around two main commitments in the area of
political inclusion:
I. Support to young people’s participation in inclusive political
processes and democratic
practices, through three measures, covering the wider enabling
environment, individual capacity
building and a specific focus on young women:
• The promotion of an enabling environment (legal
frameworks, policies and
plans) for young people’s participation in a broad range of
processes and areas
(electoral and parliamentary processes, public administration
and local
governance, including in peacebuilding environments) at local,
sub-national
and national levels;
• The promotion of young people’s skills and capacities to
participate actively indemocratic practices, including in local, national, and global
processes
(leadership trainings, etc.)
• The promotion of young women’s participation and presence
in political office
and decision-making at all levels (participation of young
women -through both
elected and non-elected positions).
II. Support to young people’s inclusion in decision making and in all
levels of development processes,
through two measures, focusing on Kenyan governance and
processes, on the one hand,
and young men and women’s contribution to the identification
and implementation of
sustainable solutions, on the other hand:
• Effective participation of young people and young people-led
organizations in
KYF governance and decision-making processes (post-2022
agenda in
particular)
• The ability of young people and young people-led
organizations to contribute
to the achievement of durable solutions for humanitarian and
peace building initiatives –focusing therefore on enabling
young women and men to become
active leaders in global efforts to achieve sustainable human
development as a long term investment.
INDEX:
Each and every county has KYF chapter and the executive of
these chapters are chosen by the youths in those chapters
during the first meeting after group formation.An overal KYF
group is being launched on Facebook and Telegram where all
Kenyan Youths will assemble.KYF are chaired by county Governors of irrespective chapters
after KYF officials have visited The Office of the Governor and
signed an agreement.
Each and every KYF chapter must have, according to hierachy
-A Chairman(County Governor)
-A Organising General (Youth)
